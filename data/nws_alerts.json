This will\nbe a PARTICULAR DANGEROUS SITUATION (PDS) Red Flag Warning event\nin many areas, with the combination of a strong offshore pressure\ngradient (LAX-Daggett peaking at -8 to -9 mb), strong cold air\nadvection, and moderate upper level wind support.\n\nAs surface high pressure builds into the Great Basin, Santa Ana\nwinds are expected to increase late Monday morning into\nafternoon, then peak Monday night into Tuesday. Offshore winds\nare expected to diminish some by Wednesday, but very dir will\npersist. With the strong likelihood of widespread single digit\nhumidities with this event, there is high confidence for a long\nduration Red Flag event. In addition, there is high confidence\nof of PDS Red Flag Warning conditions late Monday evening through\nTuesday, as damaging wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph could overlap with\nsingle digit humidities across many of the wind mountain and foothills\nareas, and with gusts of 40 to 65 mph across most wind prone coastal\nand valley areas of Los Angeles and Ventura  counties. With the\nthreat of damaging wind gusts in these windier corridors, there will\nbe an increased risk for downed trees and powerlines, along with\npower outages.\n\nThe hardest hit areas will likely be the San Gabriels, Santa\nSusanas, western Santa Monicas into Malibu, Ventura county\nvalleys (especially Simi Valley and Moorpark), western San\nFernando Valley (especially Highway 118/210 corridors from Porter\nRanch to San Fernando), and the hills above Camarillo into east\nVentura. Due to the expected long duration of dangerous fire\nweather conditions and critically dry fuels, there is the\nincreasing potential for any new ignitions to have very rapid\nfire spread and extreme fire behavior (including long range\nspotting). As a result, there is the increasing threat for fire\nweather conditions to rival other historical fires in recent\ntimes including the Mountain and Thomas Fires. Dry offshore\nconditions will likely persist into Thursday.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Los Angeles/Oxnard has issued a\nRed Flag Warning for gusty east to southeast winds and very low\nrelative humidity, which is in effect from 10 PM Monday to\n10 PM PST Tuesday. The Fire Weather Watch is no longer in effect.\n\n* WINDS...Southeast to east 15 to 30 mph with gusts to 40 mph.\n\n* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Widespread single digit humidities\ndeveloping by later Monday night or Tuesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...If fire ignition occurs, conditions are favorable\nfor rapid fire spread and extreme fire behavior which would\nthreaten life and property.",
            "instruction": "A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions\nare either occurring now, or will shortly. Use extreme caution\nwith anything that can spark a wildfire.

This will\nbe a PARTICULAR DANGEROUS SITUATION (PDS) Red Flag Warning event\nin many areas, with the combination of a strong offshore pressure\ngradient (LAX-Daggett peaking at -8 to -9 mb), strong cold air\nadvection, and moderate upper level wind support.\n\nAs surface high pressure builds into the Great Basin, Santa Ana\nwinds are expected to increase late Monday morning into\nafternoon, then peak Monday night into Tuesday. Offshore winds\nare expected to diminish some by Wednesday, but very dir will\npersist. With the strong likelihood of widespread single digit\nhumidities with this event, there is high confidence for a long\nduration Red Flag event. In addition, there is high confidence\nof of PDS Red Flag Warning conditions late Monday evening through\nTuesday, as damaging wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph could overlap with\nsingle digit humidities across many of the wind mountain and foothills\nareas, and with gusts of 40 to 65 mph across most wind prone coastal\nand valley areas of Los Angeles and Ventura  counties. With the\nthreat of damaging wind gusts in these windier corridors, there will\nbe an increased risk for downed trees and powerlines, along with\npower outages.\n\nThe hardest hit areas will likely be the San Gabriels, Santa\nSusanas, western Santa Monicas into Malibu, Ventura county\nvalleys (especially Simi Valley and Moorpark), western San\nFernando Valley (especially Highway 118/210 corridors from Porter\nRanch to San Fernando), and the hills above Camarillo into east\nVentura. Due to the expected long duration of dangerous fire\nweather conditions and critically dry fuels, there is the\nincreasing potential for any new ignitions to have very rapid\nfire spread and extreme fire behavior (including long range\nspotting). As a result, there is the increasing threat for fire\nweather conditions to rival other historical fires in recent\ntimes including the Mountain and Thomas Fires. Dry offshore\nconditions will likely persist into Thursday.\n\n* A particularly dangerous situation exists for these areas due to\nthe combination of damaging winds, single digit humidities, and\nextremely dry vegetation. Any new fire ignitions in this area will\nhave dangerous fire spread with a significant threat to life and\nproperty.\n\n* WINDS...Santa Ana winds expected to increase sharply by mid to\nlate Monday afternoon, then peak later Monday evening through\nTuesday, when speeds of 25 to 40 mph with gusts of 40 to 55\nmph will likely be common. Isolated damaging gusts of 55 to 65\nmph will be possible in the hills above Camarillo and Somis\nextending into east Ventura, as well as Point Mugu and Malibu.\n\n* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Humidities are expected to lower to around\n15 percent in many areas by late Monday afternoon or evening,\nwith widespread humidities of 5 to 10 percent likely from late\nMonday evening into Tuesday, and persisting into Wednesday,\nwith isolated readings as low as 2 percent likely.\n\n* IMPACTS...If fire ignition occurs, conditions are favorable\nfor large fires with very rapid fire spread, extreme fire\nbehavior, and long range spotting, which would threaten life\nand property. There is also the risk of damaging winds\nincluding trees and power lines, as well as power outages.",

Due to the expected long duration of dangerous fire\nweather conditions and critically dry fuels, there is the\nincreasing potential for any new ignitions to have very rapid\nfire spread and extreme fire behavior (including long range\nspotting). As a result, there is the increasing threat for fire\nweather conditions to rival other historical fires in recent\ntimes including the Mountain and Thomas Fires. Dry offshore\nconditions will likely persist into Thursday.\n\n* A particularly dangerous situation exists for this area due to\nthe combination of damaging winds, single digit humidities, and\nextremely dry vegetation. Any new fire ignitions in this area will\nhave dangerous fire spread with a significant threat to life and\nproperty.\n\n* WINDS...Santa Ana winds expected to increase sharply late\nMonday morning into afternoon, then peak Monday night into\nearly Wednesday morning. when speeds of 30 to 50 mph with gusts of\n65 to 80 mph are likely.  Offshore winds are expected to\ndiminish some by late Wednesday morning, with gusts mostly in\nthe 20 to 40 mph range.\n\n* RELATIVE HUMIDITY...Humidities are expected to lower to around\n15 percent by Monday afternoon or early evening, with widespread\nhumidities of 5 to 10 percent likely later Monday evening into\nTuesday, and persisting into Wednesday, with isolated readings as\nlow as 2 percent likely.\n\n* IMPACTS...If fire ignition occurs, conditions are favorable\nfor large fires with very rapid fire spread, extreme fire\nbehavior, and long range spotting, which would threaten life\nand property. There is also the risk of damaging winds\nincluding trees and power lines, as well as power outages.",

This will\nbe a PARTICULAR DANGEROUS SITUATION (PDS) Red Flag Warning event\nin many areas, with the combination of a strong offshore pressure\ngradient (LAX-Daggett peaking at -8 to -9 mb), strong cold air\nadvection, and moderate upper level wind support.\n\nAs surface high pressure builds into the Great Basin, Santa Ana\nwinds are expected to increase late Monday morning into\nafternoon, then peak Monday night into Tuesday. Offshore winds\nare expected to diminish some by Wednesday, but very dir will\npersist. With the strong likelihood of widespread single digit\nhumidities with this event, there is high confidence for a long\nduration Red Flag event. In addition, there is high confidence\nof of PDS Red Flag Warning conditions late Monday evening through\nTuesday, as damaging wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph could overlap with\nsingle digit humidities across many of the wind mountain and foothills\nareas, and with gusts of 40 to 65 mph across most wind prone coastal\nand valley areas of Los Angeles and Ventura  counties. With the\nthreat of damaging wind gusts in these windier corridors, there will\nbe an increased risk for downed trees and powerlines, along with\npower outages.\n\nThe hardest hit areas will likely be the San Gabriels, Santa\nSusanas, western Santa Monicas into Malibu, Ventura county\nvalleys (especially Simi Valley and Moorpark), western San\nFernando Valley (especially Highway 118/210 corridors from Porter\nRanch to San Fernando), and the hills above Camarillo into east\nVentura.

Some of the highest\nwind areas will likely be the San Gabriels, Santa Susanas,\nwestern Santa Monicas into Malibu, Ventura county valleys\n(especially Simi Valley and Moorpark), and western San\nFernando Valley (especially Highway 118/210 corridors from\nPorter Ranch to San Fernando).
